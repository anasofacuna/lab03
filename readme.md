# Kinds of Entertainment #

Personally, I really enjoy books, ballet, and film. Books have been around for a long time in all kinds of form. Originally, based on the pictures I saw on Wikipedia, scrolls were considered books, too! Ballet is a kind of dance, that in my experience has hazy origins, but it was pretty popular in Europe while one of the Louis was in the throne. Film is probably (definitely) the newest kind of entertainment of the three, eventhough it's been around for over a century! All three, however, have provided entertainment for people to make them happy or tell a story, made up or make believe.

## Ontology ##
- Kinds of entertainment have a means of presentation.
- Kinds of entertainment have a storyline.
- Kinds of entertainment have a creator.

## Taxonomy ##
Here is the example I'm going to use to break things down:
-Kind of Entertainment
  - Stage
  - Stories
  - Creator

## Choreography ##
I decided to order these by how grand their production will be. A book, while an involved process, typically lacks the presentation of a ballet. And while a ballet's stage can be quite ornamented, film's use of technology outstages other forms of entertainment. Afterwards, I narrowed it down to the scope of how I think entertainment comes to be. For example, people will first pick up a book, then engage in its story, and maybe in the end inquire about its author.
