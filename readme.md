# Kinds of Entertainment #

Personally, I really enjoy books, ballet, and film. Books have been around for a long time in all kinds of form. Originally, based on the pictures I saw on Wikipedia, scrolls were considered books, too! Ballet is a kind of dance, that in my experience has hazy origins, but it was pretty popular in Europe while one of the Louis was in the throne. Film is probably (definitely) the newest kind of entertainment of the three, eventhough it's been around for over a century! All three, however, have provided entertainment for people to make them happy or tell a story, made up or make believe.

## Ontology ##
- Kinds of entertainment have a means of presentation.
- Kinds of entertainment have a storyline.
- Kinds of entertainment have a creator.

## Taxonomy ##
Here is the example I'm going to use to break things down:

- Kind of Entertainment
  - Stage
  - Stories
  - Creator
  
### Books ###
#### Stage ####
Through history, books have been published and shared with audiences through a series of mediums. In ancient times, books could come in the shape of scrolls. However, as technology has advanced, different methods have been used to print books. There's been a shift from ink to toner even! Now, we can access books online or through ereaders, making books accessible in different ways. People can still find books in libraries and bookstores too.
#### Stories ####
Books come in different genres and for different puposes. In the past, printing and paper were deemed to expensive to be used for entertainment. Clearly, that's changed. Books can be of either fiction or nonfiction for entertainment and to tell stories. According to [wikipedia] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book), novels are the most kinds of books. Novels feature a plot, setting, theme, and characters, and are centered around any topic.
#### Creator ####
Books have authors and publishing houses. In the case of authors, they can either make up a fiction story, or they can narrate real life events. Sometimes authors will talk about themselves or their lives in an autobiography. With the work of editors and publishers, authors get their work to the public.

### Ballets ###
#### Stage ####
Ballets are often performed on actual stages. In the past, they were performed for royalty and people of high status. Although that has changed and ballet performances and lessons have been made more accessible to people, it does attract a more affluent group. Ballet can, in theory, be formored anywhere as long as there are dancers ready to perform. Some performances will feature a live orchestra playing the score, whereas others will use a recording. 
#### Stories ####
Ballets tell story through the classical ballet dance style. Sometimes, because the breadth of a story may not be easy to understand, the audience is given a pamphlet with the storyline. A lot of the time, there is a main princess involved who is having trouble in an area of her live. There might be a love interest involved. Over time, ballets have more abstract so that choreographers are able to express merely a feeling through movement and music.
#### Creator ####
One could say ballets have several creators, just like books. If you're talking about a ballet score, then an important composer like Tchaikovsky would be credited for the ballet. Choreographers are the main creators of dance. If their choreography is original or impressive enough, their ballet will be though and performed through the ages.

## Choreography ##
I decided to order these by how grand their production will be. A book, while an involved process, typically lacks the presentation of a ballet. And while a ballet's stage can be quite ornamented, film's use of technology outstages other forms of entertainment. Afterwards, I narrowed it down to the scope of how I think entertainment comes to be. For example, people will first pick up a book, then engage in its story, and maybe in the end inquire about its author.
