# Kinds of Entertainment #

Personally, I really enjoy books, ballet, and film. Books have been around for a long time in all kinds of form. Originally, based on the pictures I saw on Wikipedia, scrolls were considered books, too! Ballet is a kind of dance, that in my experience has hazy origins, but it was pretty popular in Europe while one of the Louis was in the throne. Film is probably (definitely) the newest kind of entertainment of the three, eventhough it's been around for over a century! All three, however, have provided entertainment for people to make them happy or tell a story, made up or make believe.
